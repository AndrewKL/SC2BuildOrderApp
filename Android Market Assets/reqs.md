Screenshots (Required):
    We require 2 screenshots.
    Use: Displayed on the details page for your application in Google Play.
    You may upload up to 8 screenshots.
    Specs: 320w x 480h, 480w x 800h, or 480w x 854h; 24 bit PNG or JPEG (no alpha) Full bleed, no border in art.
    Tips:Landscape thumbnails are cropped, but we preserve the image’s full size and aspect ratio if the user opens it up on Google Play app.


High Resolution Application Icon (Required):
    Use: In various locations in Google Play.
        Does not replace your launcher icon.
    Specs: 512x512, 32-bit PNG with alpha; Max size of 1024KB.
    Tips: This does not replace your launcher icon, but should be a higher-fidelity, higher-resolution version of your application's launcher icon, following the same guidelines. You can include padding in Application Icons to maintain a consistent visual weight with other icons. For example, the 512 x 512 pixel Application Icon can contain a 464 x 464 pixel shape with 48 pixels on each side for padding. This padding can also be used to make room for a subtle drop shadow, which can help ensure that launcher icons are legible on any background color.


Promotional Graphic (Optional):
    Use: In various locations in Google Play.
    Specs: 180w x 120h, 24 bit PNG or JPEG (no alpha), Full bleed, no border in art.


Feature Graphic (Optional):
    Use: The featured section in Google Play. Will be downsized to mini or micro.
    Specs: 1024w x 500h, 24 bit PNG or JPEG (no alpha) with no transparency
    Tips: Use a safe frame of 924x400 (50 pixel of safe padding on each side). All the important content of the graphic should be within this safe frame. Pixels outside of this safe frame may be cropped for stylistic purposes.   If incorporating text, use large font sizes, and keep the graphic simple, as this graphic may be scaled down from its original size. This graphic may be displayed alone without the app icon.
